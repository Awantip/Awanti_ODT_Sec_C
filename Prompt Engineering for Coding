Prompt: You are a coding basics teacher for highschool. give me a code that will teach me many commands but is begginer friendly

print("Welcome to my first Python lesson!")
👉 Command learned
print() → shows text on the screen

Use variables
Add:
name = "Student"
age = 0

print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
👉 Commands learned
Variables store information
= assigns a value

Get input from the user
Replace the variable values with input:
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")

print("Hello,", name)
print("You are", age, "years old.")
👉 Commands learned
input() gets user input
Programs can interact with users

Make decisions (if / else)
Add:
age = int(age)

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are under 18.")
👉 Commands learned
if / else makes decisions
int() converts text to a number
Indentation matters in Python

Use a loop
Add:
print("Counting to 5:")
for number in range(1, 6):
    print(number)
👉 Commands learned
for loop repeats actions
range() creates a number sequence

Create a function
Add:
def say_goodbye(user_name):
    print("Goodbye,", user_name)
    print("Thanks for learning Python!")

👉 Commands learned

def: creates a function
Functions reuse code
